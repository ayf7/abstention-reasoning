You are solving a word-grouping puzzle with the following rules:
- There are 9 words.
- Your goal is to group them into 3 groups of 3 words each.
- Each group of 3 words shares a common theme or category.
- Each word belongs to exactly one group (no overlaps).

Here are the 9 words:
{words}

Your task:
- Group the 9 words into 3 groups of 3 words each.
- Think step by step and justify your choices.

Output format:
- After your thinking, provide a single line beginning with `Answer:`.
- Each group of words must be enclosed in square brackets `[]`, with the 3 words (in all caps) separated by commas.
- The 3 groups themselves must also be separated by commas, enclosed in braces `{{}}`.
- Concretely, the format should be:
  Answer: {{[<word>, <word>, <word>], [<word>, <word>, <word>], [<word>, <word>, <word>]}}
- Finally, end your response with <|endoftext|>.
