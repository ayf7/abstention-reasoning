Answer the given question. You should first have a reasoning process in mind and then provide the answer. Show your reasoning in <think> </think> tags.

You are solving a word-grouping puzzle with the following rules:
- There are {total_words} words.
- Your goal is to group them into {group_count} groups of {words_per_group} words each.
- Each group of {words_per_group} words shares a common theme or category.
- Each word belongs to exactly one group (no overlaps).

Here are the {total_words} words:
{words}

Group the {total_words} words into {group_count} groups of {words_per_group} words each. When you reach the answer, enclose each group inside square brackets `[]` with the {words_per_group} words (in all caps) separated by commas. Finally, wrap the braces in <answer> </answer> tags. Your answer should be in the format <answer> {example_answer} </answer>. End your response with <|endoftext|>.
