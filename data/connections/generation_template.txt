You are solving a word-grouping puzzle with the following rules:
- There are 16 words.
- Your goal is to group them into 4 groups of 4 words each.
- Each group of 4 words shares a common theme or category.
- Each word belongs to exactly one group (no overlaps).

Contest: {contest}

Here are the 16 words:
{words}

Your task:
- Group the 16 words into 4 groups of 4 words each.
- For each group, give a short description of what the words have in common.
- Think step by step, explaining how you identify each group before giving the final groups.

Output format:
- After your reasoning, provide a single line beginning with `Answer:`.
- Each group of words must be enclosed in square brackets `[]`, with the 4 words (in all caps) separated by commas.
- The 4 groups themselves must also be separated by commas.
- Concretely, the format should be:
  Answer: [<word>, <word>, <word>, <word>], [<word>, <word>, <word>, <word>], [<word>, <word>, <word>, <word>], [<word>, <word>, <word>, <word>]
