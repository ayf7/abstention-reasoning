You are playing a numbers game similar to Countdown.

Your goal is to reach the target number using the given numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷).

Target: {target}
Numbers: {nums}

Rules:
- You may use each number at most once.
- You can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- You do not have to use all the numbers, but you should try to get exactly the target.

Think step by step, showing your intermediate calculations, then give the final expression that reaches (or is as close as possible to) the target.

Output format:
- After your reasoning, write a single line beginning with `Answer:`.
- On that line, include your final expression and its value, with the expression and value enclosed in LaTeX-style box notation.
- Concretely, the format should be: Answer: \boxed{<expression> = <value>}.
