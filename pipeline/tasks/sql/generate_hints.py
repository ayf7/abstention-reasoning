"""Generate incremental solution hints for Text-to-SQL problems using TRAPI.

Divides the reasoning and query formulation into 5 sequential hint segments:
- hint_1: High-level table/schema identification and query strategy
- hint_2: Table relationships, join paths, or initial query framing
- hint_3: Filtering conditions or predicate logic (may include partial SQL syntax like WHERE clause fragments)
- hint_4: Aggregations, groupings, or subquery construction (may include partial SQL expressions)
- hint_5: High-level guidance on the final output projection/order without revealing the full query or complete SQL

Each hint is stored INDEPENDENTLY (not cumulative) for token efficiency.
At runtime, concatenate hint_1 + ... + hint_k to reveal the first k/5 of the hints.

Usage:
    python -m pipeline.tasks.sql.rewrite_solutions_prefix_hints \
        --input data/sql/primitives_spider_dev.json \
        --output data/sql/primitives_spider_dev_hints.json \

You are an expert SQL tutor guiding students to solve Text-to-SQL problems step-by-step using progressive hints.

Your task: Given the database schema, question (and optional evidence or intermediate turns), along with the target SQL answer, divide the solution reasoning path into exactly 5 sequential, independent hints (hint_1 to hint_5).

## Guidelines for 5-Step Hint Progression:
1. **Exactly 5 Hints**:
   - You MUST generate exactly 5 hints (`hint_1`, `hint_2`, `hint_3`, `hint_4`, `hint_5`).
   - Break the reasoning into 5 distinct, meaningful logical steps (e.g., conceptual strategy / schema linking, join conditions, filtering logic, aggregation / grouping / subquery formulation, final projection / ordering).
2. **Constructive Actions ONLY (No Negative Hints)**:
   - Every hint must tell the student what TO DO.
   - NEVER output negative statements about what is not needed. Do NOT say "no joins are needed", "no WHERE clause is needed", "no grouping required", "do not add a filter", etc. Focus 100% on constructive steps toward building the query.
3. **Table & Column Mentions Only When Non-Trivial**:
   - Only mention table or column names when it is non-trivial, tricky, requires disambiguation between multiple candidate tables, or involves translating domain evidence/formulas.
   - Do not waste an entire hint merely stating the obvious if a table directly matches the entity in the question.
4. **Use Partial SQL Where Helpful**:
   - Intermediate hints can and should include relevant partial SQL snippets or clauses when it helps clarity (for example: `JOIN ... ON ...`, `WHERE ...`, `GROUP BY ...`, `HAVING ...`, subquery fragments, or arithmetic/aggregate expressions).
   - Do not include SQL in every hint; keep conceptual framing natural.
5. **CRITICAL Rule for the Final Hint (hint_5)**:
   - The final hint (`hint_5`) must NEVER give the complete SQL statement. It should guide the final step (e.g. specifying the projection, ordering, limit, or formatting), leaving the final query assembly for the student.
6. **Leverage Intermediate Turns / Evidence**:
   - If intermediate conversational turns or domain evidence are provided, use them to guide the natural progression of steps.

## Example 1 (Multi-Table Join & Filtering)

**Question:** What are the names of car makers who produced cars in 1970?
**Target SQL:** `SELECT DISTINCT T1.Maker FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN MODEL_LIST AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.Maker JOIN CAR_NAMES AS T3 ON T2.model = T3.model JOIN CARS_DATA AS T4 ON T3.MakeId = T4.id WHERE T4.year = '1970';`

**Output:**
{
  "hint_1": "Recognize that maker names and production years reside in separate tables, requiring a join chain from `CAR_MAKERS` through `MODEL_LIST` and `CAR_NAMES` to `CARS_DATA`.",
  "hint_2": "Connect `CAR_MAKERS` to `MODEL_LIST` on `T1.Id = T2.Maker`.",
  "hint_3": "Complete the path to `CARS_DATA` by joining `MODEL_LIST.model = CAR_NAMES.model` and `CAR_NAMES.MakeId = CARS_DATA.id`.",
  "hint_4": "Filter for the target production year using `WHERE T4.year = '1970'`.",
  "hint_5": "Project the `Maker` column from `CAR_MAKERS`, applying `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicate names for makers with multiple models."
}

## Example 2 (Aggregations, Ratios & Calculations)

**Question:** What percentage of clients who opened their accounts in districts with an average salary over 10000 are women?
**Evidence:** Female refers to gender = 'F'; Average salary is in column A11
**Target SQL:** `SELECT CAST(SUM(T2.gender = 'F') AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T2.client_id) FROM district AS T1 INNER JOIN client AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id WHERE T1.A11 > 10000`

**Output:**
{
  "hint_1": "Link client demographics to district economic data using `district.district_id = client.district_id`.",
  "hint_2": "Restrict the records to high-salary regions using the condition `WHERE T1.A11 > 10000`.",
  "hint_3": "Count the female clients in this subset using conditional aggregation `SUM(gender = 'F')`.",
  "hint_4": "Compute the ratio by dividing the female count by total matched clients `COUNT(T2.client_id)` and multiplying by 100.",
  "hint_5": "Cast the numerator to REAL in the final SELECT expression to avoid integer truncation in SQLite."
}

## Example 3 (Subqueries & Nested Aggregation)

**Question:** Find the names of all courses that have enrolled more students than the average course enrollment.
**Target SQL:** `SELECT T1.course_name FROM courses AS T1 JOIN enrollments AS T2 ON T1.course_id = T2.course_id GROUP BY T1.course_id HAVING count(T2.student_id) > (SELECT avg(c) FROM (SELECT count(student_id) AS c FROM enrollments GROUP BY course_id))`

**Output:**
{
  "hint_1": "Construct an inner subquery to calculate the enrollment count per course: `SELECT count(student_id) AS c FROM enrollments GROUP BY course_id`.",
  "hint_2": "Wrap that subquery with `avg(c)` to compute the benchmark average enrollment across all courses.",
  "hint_3": "Join `courses` with `enrollments` on `course_id` and group records by course to aggregate individual enrollments.",
  "hint_4": "Add a `HAVING count(T2.student_id) > (...)` clause comparing each course's enrollment against the benchmark subquery.",
  "hint_5": "Project `course_name` in the final SELECT to list the qualifying courses."
}

## Output Format:
Return ONLY a JSON object with exactly 5 keys `hint_1`, `hint_2`, `hint_3`, `hint_4`, `hint_5` (no markdown code blocks):
{"hint_1": "...", "hint_2": "...", "hint_3": "...", "hint_4": "...", "hint_5": "..."}

PARTIAL_SQL_HINTS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert SQL tutor guiding students to solve Text-to-SQL problems step-by-step using progressive solution hints that provide accompanying partial SQL.

Your task: Given the database schema, question (and optional evidence or intermediate turns), along with the target SQL answer, divide the solution into exactly 5 sequential, independent hint segments (hint_1 to hint_5).

## Core Philosophy:
Drawing a direct parallel with mathematical problem solving (where each step provides both a clear explanation and the concrete equation/work that solves that step), each hint must provide a rich, clear explanation accompanied by the EXACT partial SQL clause, expression, or snippet that solves that step. This ensures the student understands the reasoning and has the exact SQL syntax for that sub-goal, preventing syntax or join errors on previously solved steps.

## Guidelines for 5-Step Progression:
1. **Exactly 5 Hints**:
   - You MUST generate exactly 5 hints (`hint_1`, `hint_2`, `hint_3`, `hint_4`, `hint_5`).
2. **Mix of Explanation and Accompanying Partial SQL**:
   - Every single hint must blend a 1-2 sentence explanation of the logical step with the exact accompanying partial SQL code in backticks (e.g., `FROM ... JOIN ... ON ...`, `WHERE ...`, `GROUP BY ...`, `HAVING ...`, `ORDER BY ... LIMIT ...`, or `SELECT ...`).
   - The explanation provides context (which entities are being related, what condition is being tested, what calculation is being performed), while the partial SQL provides the precise syntax, table aliases, and column names.
3. **Constructive Actions ONLY (No Negative Hints)**:
   - Focus 100% on constructive steps toward building the query. NEVER include negative statements like "no joins needed", "no WHERE clause required", or "do not filter".
4. **Accurate Schema Names and Aliases**:
   - The partial SQL snippet must use the exact table names, column names, aliases, and SQL dialect functions from the target SQL answer.
5. **CRITICAL Rule for the Final Hint (hint_5)**:
   - hint_5 must NOT output the entire complete SQL query as a single finished line.
   - It should guide the final step (e.g. specifying the projection/SELECT clause, sorting/limit, or query assembly), leaving the final full query assembly to the student.
6. **Cumulative Solution Walkthrough**:
   - When hints 1 through 5 are read together, they provide both the complete conceptual walkthrough and all constituent partial SQL building blocks necessary to compose the target query.

## Example 1 (Multi-Table Join & Filtering)

**Question:** What are the names of car makers who produced cars in 1970?
**Target SQL:** `SELECT DISTINCT T1.Maker FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN MODEL_LIST AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.Maker JOIN CAR_NAMES AS T3 ON T2.model = T3.model JOIN CARS_DATA AS T4 ON T3.MakeId = T4.id WHERE T4.year = '1970';`

**Output:**
{
  "hint_1": "Recognize that maker names and production years reside in separate tables, and start by linking `CAR_MAKERS` to `MODEL_LIST`: `FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN MODEL_LIST AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.Maker`.",
  "hint_2": "Complete the join chain through model names to car production records on matching keys: `JOIN CAR_NAMES AS T3 ON T2.model = T3.model JOIN CARS_DATA AS T4 ON T3.MakeId = T4.id`.",
  "hint_3": "Filter the combined records to restrict specifically to cars manufactured in 1970: `WHERE T4.year = '1970'`.",
  "hint_4": "Select maker names with deduplication to avoid repeated entries for manufacturers with multiple 1970 models: `SELECT DISTINCT T1.Maker`.",
  "hint_5": "Assemble the final query by placing the `SELECT DISTINCT` projection before the 4-table join and year filter."
}

## Example 2 (Aggregations, Ratios & Calculations)

**Question:** What percentage of clients who opened their accounts in districts with an average salary over 10000 are women?
**Evidence:** Female refers to gender = 'F'; Average salary is in column A11
**Target SQL:** `SELECT CAST(SUM(T2.gender = 'F') AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T2.client_id) FROM district AS T1 INNER JOIN client AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id WHERE T1.A11 > 10000`

**Output:**
{
  "hint_1": "Link district economic records to client demographic data using their shared district identifier: `FROM district AS T1 INNER JOIN client AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id`.",
  "hint_2": "Restrict the joined rows to high-salary regions where column A11 exceeds 10,000: `WHERE T1.A11 > 10000`.",
  "hint_3": "Count the number of female clients in this subset using conditional summation: `SUM(T2.gender = 'F')`.",
  "hint_4": "Count the total number of matched clients in these districts to form the denominator: `COUNT(T2.client_id)`.",
  "hint_5": "Compute the female percentage in the SELECT clause, casting the numerator to REAL to avoid integer truncation: `SELECT CAST(SUM(T2.gender = 'F') AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T2.client_id)`."

**Output:**
